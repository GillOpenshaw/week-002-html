Issue:
Every August London theatres offer a number of free and discounted child theatre tickets for every 
adult ticket purchased in a scheme called "KidsWeek" www.kidsweek.co.uk. Over the past couple years a
large Facebook community has grown called "Families Who ❤️Theatre", in addition to the "KidsWeek"  
Facebook page, in which people ask questions and provide answers about theatre tickets & shows, where
to stay, and other non-theatre family activities to do while in London.
The problem is that as new people join the group, or people don't follow every post, then the same 
questions get asked over and over again.

Solution:
I would like to develop a website that allows people to access relevant information and an app that
creates a ToDo London Trip Planner that provides the following:
    1. Theatre tickets - often people want to buy additional theatre tickets onto top of their KidsWeek
    purchases
    2. Travel information to London - train, bus, flights
    3. Travel information around London - oyster, travelcards, options for best value
    4. Accommodation - cheap & affordable family accommodation
    5. Food and drink - restaurants, take outs, ice cream parlours
    6. Shopping - high street, markets
    7. Other family attractions & activities - options available & discount ticket info
The website would act as the main source of information, while the app would allow a tailored trip to
be created for an individual family's needs. The itinerary for the trip could be organised by date, or
by section - travel, accommodation, theatre tickets, food & drink, shopping, activities.
